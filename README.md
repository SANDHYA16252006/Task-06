In this task, I implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using a dataset called iris_extended.csv. The goal was to classify flower types based on their features.I started by loading the data and removing any non-numeric columns. I also converted the target column into class labels. Then, I normalized the data using StandardScaler to ensure fair distance calculations.The dataset was split into training and testing sets. I trained the KNN model with different values of K (from 1 to 10) and checked which one gave the best accuracy.Finally, I visualized the accuracy for each K value and used a confusion matrix to evaluate the final modelâ€™s performance. I completed the task using Python and libraries.
